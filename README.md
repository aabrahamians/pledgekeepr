#PledgeKeeper
### A management system based on assigning quotas to "Pledgekeepers(PK)" and points to tasks... Completeing a task creating by the group admin allows the PK to deduct from their quota and thus showing commitment to their promiss. 

--------------- 
**```Basic ussage```**

- **1st:** An Admin must sign up and create a group. Within the group he must create tasks and assign points for each one. He is also given an invitation code.
- **2nd:** The Pledges are given an invitation code which will automatically add them to the group created by the admin. Once they have joined the group they can log in to see available tasks. Now they are able to claim and a task to complete which will subtract points from their quota.



---------------
##Inprogress:
- **Mailer:**  Admin will be able to email an invitation link as well as sharing an invitation code. Pledges can be emailed a reminder of their quota.
